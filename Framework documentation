Ethical Considerations:

    This tool is designed exclusively for:

        Personal security monitoring

        System administration

        Malware detection and prevention

    It includes no capabilities for:

        Keystroke logging

        Data exfiltration

        Unauthorized surveillance

    Proper use requires:

        Running on systems you own or administer

        Obtaining proper consent when used in organizational settings

        Compliance with all applicable laws

Implementation Notes:

For a production version, you would need to:

    Implement a proper threat intelligence feed

    Add more sophisticated detection heuristics

    Create proper quarantine functionality

    Add user authentication for enterprise use

    Implement regular automatic updates
